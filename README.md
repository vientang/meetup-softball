**`/amplify`**: The directory that contains all of the cloud formation templates and configurations for AWS.

**`/src`**: The directory that contains all of the front end code related to the site.

**`gatsby-browser.js`**: File where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

**`gatsby-config.js`**: Main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

**`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install.

**`contributing.md`**: Markdown file containing useful reference information about this project.
